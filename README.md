# API-Data_Wrangling
In this mini project, we will pull some data from the Qunadl API. Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data. For this mini project, we will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X. We will convert the JSON responses getting from API map to python dictonaries. Then we will Calculate the highest and lowest opening prices for the stock in this period, the largest change in any one day (based on High and Low price), the largest change between any two days (based on Closing Price), the average daily trading volume during this year.
